### So What was the turning point?
A simple thing, When you're curious about your startup and it starts getting bigger every day, you should think about leaving your current job and focus on the startup, so I took the decision to focus on startup and left writing and other things..., But as we're now ready to jump in the market with social media marketing, So I'll focus more on Marketing and Learning Growth Hacking.

From Next Week, I'll start learning React-Native + Marketing. I'll also make Youtube Live Streams, and maybe write some blogs too.

I'll try to curate the traffic that I'm getting, that most people are working really hard for.


Thanks.. for reading my thoughts, What you think about it?

I learned TailwindCSS and now I love it more than any CSS.
