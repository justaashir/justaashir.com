  I was really scared of my writing before, that I'm not so good and I can't write. I found DEV and wrote my post just for fun but I got an amazing reaction on it, It was so unexpected, it motivated me to write more and Today I'm sharing my own story from 0 to 1.

I was really scared of my writing before, that I'm not so good and I can't write. I found DEV and wrote my post just for fun but I got an amazing reaction on it, It was so unexpected, it motivated me to write more and Today I'm sharing my own story from 0 to 1.
#### Joined DEV
I joined DEV on 15 of Sep, I found it on Twitter. Someone mentioned it that it's the best place to share your thoughts, so I wrote my first post the same day.

#### My First Post

[Bulma - The Most Underrated Framework of the CSS Framework Era
](https://dev.to/justaashir/bulma-the-most-underrated-framework-of-the-css-framework-era-2gj8) it was my first post and it really got me so much attention. I was shocked that how can my first post achieve this number of views and reactions, My goal was to feature on The DEV community Twitter Handle at least in 10 posts but my first post got me this. I was happy, answering the people in the comments section.

#### My Study About SSGs
![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/2ogw15i18y32m6o6epsn.png)
I was trying SSGs and JAMstack at that time so I wrote my experience about it, and what! people really liked it and just check out the [comments section](https://dev.to/justaashir/static-site-generators-are-not-for-me-my-experience-with-jekyll-hugo-and-netlifycms-4mo5). It is Incredible! It got me so much traffic on my twitter! **I also crossed 1000 Followers on DEV**

#### The Down Time
I wrote 5 more articles after that about my [design approach](https://dev.to/justaashir/part-1-design-approach-i-am-using-right-now-for-my-web-design-projects-coffee-shop-website-1ni6) and many more. but it didn't get me so many reactions or views. They were average I think! But My Follower Count was increasing, crossed 2000 followers on DEV

#### Life Changer
![Alt Text](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/x23jge8ac792s53mb1aq.png)
[The article](https://dev.to/justaashir/web-development-projects-that-can-definitely-get-you-a-job-in-2019-2020-4c36) I posted because to complete the week for 8-week Badge, it was not planned at all. I posted it just to fill up space. I slept that night after posting it, I woke up in the morning and was shocked by seeing the reaction and views count, it crossed 150+ reactions it's first 8 hours. I got so much traffic everywhere, I was happy to see it after a very long time but was not expecting it to perform a lot better and grows up to the most popular post of the week, with 850+ reactions and 40000+ views. Some of the Bloggers contacted me to write on their blog, I got my first internship as a VueJs Front End Web developer and I have to say it changed my life.

### Crossed the 4000 followers and Got 4 Badges
I crossed 4000 followers on DEV then I think It's a good idea to start earning some side-income by writing for others, I had 20 credits at that time because of the badges of "Most Popular Vue Editor", "4 and 8 Week Streak". I posted a listing on DEV and it really helped me, I wrote for so many blogs as a ghostwriter and wrote a post for [Codewall about Kubernetes](https://www.codewall.co.uk/what-is-kubernetes-what-is-it-used-for/), Wrote about [Amezmo](https://www.amezmo.com/) and many more.

#### I'm just starting
I'm just starting now, I hope you'll read more from me in Future on many platforms, and I'm looking to generate quality content. [I'm still available to write paid content for you](https://dev.to/listings/forhire/i-can-write-some-amazing-content-for-your-blog-acn).

### Right now
I don't know maybe it's less but as today my profile has 100,000+ views and 1600+ reactions and 6000+ followers and 5 badges in total.
Share your story and Stats about your profile, and tell me that is this Stats good for me in 2 months??
