Hi, are you looking for better opportunities and want to share your thoughts with a lot more people. It's not hard, you just need some tips and tricks and get this thing in your mind that "It's not possible in one day or a week." You have to work on it and pay continuous attention to it every day.

## Choose a name

Yes, this is not a typo. You've to name yourself on the internet, and it will impact all the things. Maybe your name is like "[Aashir Aamir Khan](justaashir.com)" or "[Kate Efimova](https://twitter.com/kefimochi)" or "[Kelly Vaughn](https://twitter.com/kvlly)". It'll be much easier for people to remember you by a short memorable reference than your name. So pick up a name that you do love and then use it everywhere from domain to all the social media to emails. be sure with that name and check out the availability everywhere.

*For Example:*

**kvlly = Kelly Vaughn**

**kefimochi = Kate Efimova**

**justaashir = Aashir Aamir Khan**

## Start using Twitter as a very first step

Stop running away from [twitter](https://twitter.com/), I'm still regretting it. I never thought that twitter can be used for self-promotion, I thought that it's for movies and politics but It shocked me when I used it and It got me a lot of work and I made so many connections.

#### How to use Twitter?

Just make an account and put up a professional headshot, and write a short bio. your brand name should be your twitter username then just follow 20 people at the very start according to your niche. Your feed is ready, now use twitter for 3-4 days and just like posts & pictures. only re-tweet when you are sure about it. Learn from others that how they are tweeting, what they are tweeting?

Start tweeting on #hashtags according to your niche, and post some articles from the web, and take part in twitter chats.

Share your code with screenshots and do live screencasts. You'll get at-least 100 organic followers in 2-3 weeks.

**One Tip:** If you scratch their back, they will scratch yours.  Follow other people they will definitely follow you back

Blogging is the easiest and cheapest way to reach out to people. Don't get scared by your writing skill, just start writing and by this, you'll gain enough self-confidence and followers;

#### But How?

You can start blogging on [*Medium* ](https://www.medium.com)as it's free to use and very easy to start.

If you are ready to invest some bucks into this then you should be looking up directly for [WordPress ](https://www.wordpress.org)as it's the most stable and efficient way to blog.

**Note for Programmers & Developers:** There is a platform called [DEV ](https://www.dev.to)specifically for developers to blog, and it's amazing. just blog there and you'll be embraced by a wonderful community.

## Buy a .com Domain

You've to buy a domain for your brand name to secure it. It's a major sign of your existence and professionalism. Just buy it, it'll only cost you a few bucks. You can then point it to your Twitter account or blog. If you want to invest more than you can create a well-looking website for yourself. don't buy anything other than .com

**Note for Programmers & Developers:** Developers must need a portfolio/blog website, just roll up a [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) and put up a professional website.

## Create a Professional Email

This is a major point to make a great impact on people, as I get 60% more replies in emails from clients just because of my website's email like `hello@justaashir.com`. You shouldn't be using a [Gmail ](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/)or [outlook](https://www.outlook.com). You can create an email when you buy the domain.

**Note for Programmers & Developers:** You can create an unlimited amount of email aliases for free using [ImproveMX](https://www.improvemx.com). it's amazing and I'm going to write an article about it in the future.
