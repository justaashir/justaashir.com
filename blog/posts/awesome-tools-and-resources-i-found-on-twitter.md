### [Static Forms](https://www.staticforms.xyz/)
I was just surfing through Twitter, I am following [Guillermo ](https://twitter.com/rauchg), He shared the [StaticForms](https://www.staticforms.xyz/) by [Hussain Fakhruddin](https://twitter.com/hussainanjar) and then I tried it, I was shocked by this, It was easy to set up on your Static website. and then I researched it, read  [Privacy Policy](https://www.staticforms.xyz/privacy). It was Flat, so No Privacy Concerns and Now I am obsessed with it.
