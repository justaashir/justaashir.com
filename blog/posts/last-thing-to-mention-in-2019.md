Happy Holidays ðŸŽ‰
Just wanted to wish you blessings. I wasn't thinking about coming back to DEV before 2020 but I really love the community and I can't leave it :)

Next Decade is important for us, not just about creating new things but improving our living standard. We've to plant more trees, and support the charaties. Let's work together to make the upcoming decade 'Accessability Era' and revise all of the work we've done in past few years. We're all teachers and students(at the same time). Let's work hard to make this ðŸ’ª community strong.

Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰ in advance and motivate yourself with this quote:

"A successful man is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him."
David Brinkley
