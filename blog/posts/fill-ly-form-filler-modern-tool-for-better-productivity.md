### How to Use Fill.ly
This is a very simple practical example of a Checkout Form, it’s on my computer right now, and I’m running it on a Localhost.

*Scenario*: It’s a checkout form, and the problem is that MySQL database is not getting the Credit Card Number, from the form correctly. So I want to fix it out but every time I have to Hard-Refresh the page,  which means filling up the entire form again and again.
I have to fill up my form the very first time and then save the form using the FIll.ly Hotkey **ALT + SHIFT + 2**:

Then after a hard refresh, I don’t have to fill-up the form again, I can easily retrieve the saved form, with the  Fill.ly HotKey **ALT + SHIFT + 1**:

#### What's Domain Mapping?
Domain mapping is using the saved forms on different instances of an app. For example, I’m using the fill.ly forms with the app in my local development environment, and then I uploaded the app to Netlify, this doesn’t mean that I can’t access the fill.ly forms. I can access them by mapping the local development environment’s domain to my netlify domain like this.

1.  Visit the Domain Mappings in Settings of Fill.ly
2. Add a new mapping, Enter the domains and done.
